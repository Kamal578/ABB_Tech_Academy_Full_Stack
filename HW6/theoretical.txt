  AJAX is a technique in web development that creates interactive and dynamic
  web pages. It lets web browsers communicate with a server to get and send data
  without reloading the whole page. This makes it possible to update specific
  parts of a webpage smoothly without disturbing the user's experience. In
  simpler terms, AJAX allows websites to fetch new information from a server and
  display it on the page without refreshing everything. For example, think of a
  social media platform where you can like or comment on a post without the
  whole page reloading. That's what AJAX does! JavaScript, which is the
  programming language used on the web, plays a crucial role in implementing
  AJAX. With JavaScript, developers can make requests to a server, receive the
  response, and update the webpage dynamically. This enables real-time updates,
  interactive forms, auto-suggestions, and other features that enhance web
  application functionality and interactivity. To sum it up, AJAX is a powerful
  tool that makes web pages more interactive, responsive, and user-friendly by
  enabling data retrieval and updates without needing a complete page reload.
